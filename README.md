What is Mr. BallGuy 2?
======================

Mr. BallGuy 2 is the sequal to my first LÖVE game, "Mr. BallGuy".

Who is developing Mr. BallGuy 2?
================================

Mr. BallGuy was originally created by me, Eamonn Rea. But, since then, I've started up a small indie team called "Game Dev Studios". We are currently developing Mr. BallGuy 2. I am coding the game, and Ryan Griffin is designing the music and most of the graphics. Some of the graphics are from the original Mr. BallGuy though.

Are you using any external libraries in Mr. BallGuy 2?
======================================================

Yes, actually, we are. We are using Lua for the code, of course. LÖVE is a 2D Lua game entine. Other than LÖVE itself, we are using some external libraries, which are:

LöveFrames<br/>
LoveAchievements<br/>
lovedebug<br/>
AnAL<br/>
tween.lua<br/>

Thank you to the creators of those libraries.

Is Mr. BallGuy 2 a finished project?
====================================

No, it is not. It is far from a finished project. It will be fully open source though.
