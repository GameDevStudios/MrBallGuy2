What is Mr. BallGuy 2?
======================

Mr. BallGuy 2 is the sequal to my first LÖVE game, "Mr. BallGuy".

Who is developing Mr. BallGuy 2?
================================

Mr. BallGuy was originally created by me, Eamonn Rea. But, since then, I've started up a small indie team called "Game Dev Studios". We are currently developing Mr. BallGuy 2. I am coding the game, and Ryan Griffin is designing the music and most of the graphics. Some of the graphics are from the original Mr. BallGuy though.

Are you using any external libraries in Mr. BallGuy 2?
======================================================

Yes, actually, we are. We are using Lua for the code, of course. LÖVE is a 2D Lua game entine. Other than LÖVE itself, we are using some external libraries, which are:

LöveFrames<br/>
LoveAchievements<br/>
lovedebug<br/>
AnAL<br/>
tween.lua<br/>

Thank you to the creators of those libraries.

Is Mr. BallGuy 2 a finished project?
====================================

No, it is not. It is far from a finished project. It will be fully open source though.

What is planned for Mr. BallGuy 2?
===================================

Mr. BallGuy 2 will hopefully be very extensible. I'm still working on ideas, and they're changing every day, but here are some planned features:<br/>

FULL Modding Support<br/>
A mod software centre<br/>
Texture Pack Support<br/>
Achievements<br/>
Multiple "Accounts"<br/>
Multiplayer -- Global and Local<br/>

They are not all of the planned features, but those are just some of the ideas I have planned.

Can you give a release date for the game?
=========================================

Well... yes AND no. I hope to have a demo out in early 2014, but maybe Mid-2014? That's what I'm hoping for, but I wont rush it if it's not done yet. I know a lot of people follow a particular quote, and I follow it too: "It's ready when it's ready!".

Can I contribute?
=================

Of course! How? You can report issues, suggest ideas, and even ask to help development. You are free to send in art for the game or music, provided it is not copyrighted and I am free to use.
